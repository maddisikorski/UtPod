In this program, the main goal is to learn how to use the basic of C++. The program teaches about Object Oriented
Programming.
To begin, you must unzip the files. Inside this zipped folder, you will find a
-Song.cpp
-UtPod.cpp
-UtPodDriver.cpp
-readme.txt
-makefile

Song.cpp and UtPod.cpp also have header files.

Compile the file to ensure they are all linked.
g++ -o UtPod Song.cpp UtPod.cpp UtPodDriver.cpp

Compiling can also be done by typing in the command line after being in the program directory: make

Then, run the code. In order to run the code, you must type in the command line: ./UtPod

linux prompt> ./UtPod

The code will show the functionality of checking memory space, adding songs, removing songs, shuffling song lists, and
sorting song lists. UtPod contains many types of test cases for each function.
